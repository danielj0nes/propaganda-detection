# Prompt / Response Testing
This document serves as a formatted record of the test prompts and responses that were sent to and received from ChatGPT. We start out by attempting to get ChatGPT to define a prompt for itself based on the propaganda techniques and definitions from Martino et al. Using this work, a base prompt is developed, tested, and subsequently refined until the final prompt template is determined. Note that Certain prompt / response combinations are not listed due to the degree of similarity to prior attempts.

## Response 1

Prompt:

Analyze the following article for the presence of propaganda techniques. Identify at least three techniques used and explain how they are employed in the article.

Title: "Why Our Country Needs Stronger Border Control Measures"

As a nation, we must prioritize the safety and security of our citizens above all else. However, recent events have shown us that our current border control measures are insufficient. The influx of illegal immigrants and drugs pouring into our country has led to a rise in crime and a strain on our resources. We cannot allow this to continue any longer.

Name calling - The article uses the term "illegal immigrants" which is an insulting label often used to demonize and dehumanize immigrants. This label suggests that all immigrants who enter the country without proper documentation are criminals, despite the fact that many of them come to the U.S. to seek asylum or a better life for themselves and their families.

Appeal to fear - The article instills fear in readers by suggesting that illegal immigration and drug trafficking are leading to a rise in crime and a strain on resources. This appeal to fear is meant to persuade readers to support stronger border control measures without considering alternative solutions that may be more effective and humane.

Loaded language - The article uses emotionally charged language to evoke strong feelings in readers. For example, the use of words like "influx" and "pouring" suggest that illegal immigrants and drugs are flooding into the country, overwhelming our systems and creating chaos. This language is intended to paint a dire picture of the situation at the border and elicit an emotional response from readers.

By using these propaganda techniques, the article attempts to sway readers towards a particular viewpoint without providing a balanced or nuanced analysis of the issue. As readers, it is important to be aware of these techniques and to critically evaluate the arguments being presented.

**Create a prompt for ChatGPT based on the techniques and definitions that can be used to detect whether they are present in a given article.**

## Response 2
Prompt:

Read the following news article and identify at least three propaganda techniques used in the article. Explain how each technique is employed and evaluate how effective it is in persuading readers.

Title: "Why Vaccines are Not Safe: The Hidden Dangers You Need to Know About"

As more and more people rush to get vaccinated, it's important to take a closer look at the risks associated with these so-called "safe" vaccines. Despite what the mainstream media would have you believe, vaccines are not without their dangers. From dangerous side effects to long-term health risks, there are a number of reasons why you should think twice before getting vaccinated.

Doubt - The article questions the credibility of the mainstream media by suggesting that they are not giving a complete picture of the risks associated with vaccines. By casting doubt on the reliability of the media, the article attempts to persuade readers to believe its own claims about vaccine dangers.

Loaded language - The article uses emotionally charged language to appeal to readers' fears and prejudices. For example, by referring to vaccines as "so-called safe," the article suggests that vaccines are not really safe, despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary. This loaded language is meant to create a sense of alarm and urgency in readers.

Straw men - The article presents a distorted and exaggerated version of the opposing viewpoint (i.e., that vaccines are safe and effective) and then refutes it. By misrepresenting the opposing argument, the article is able to make its own arguments seem more convincing by comparison.

Overall, this article uses several propaganda techniques to sow doubt and fear in readers' minds about the safety of vaccines. However, the arguments presented are not based on scientific evidence and are likely to mislead readers. It is important for readers to critically evaluate the claims made in articles like this one and to seek out reliable sources of information about vaccine safety.

* Straw men - No.
* Whataboutism - No.

**Verdict**: The text is not propaganda.

The text presents both sides of the argument, with the Kremlin denying the accusations, and it cites credible sources, such as the US government and the Washington Post. Therefore, it is a factual news report rather than propaganda.

## Prompt 6
**The following are a list of propaganda techniques and their definitions**:

**The text is not propaganda**. The text presents information that the US Ambassador to the UN alleges Russia has created a plan to either kill, inflict harm upon, or exile dissidents and minority groups living in Ukraine. The text cites credible information obtained by the US, which suggests that Russian forces are creating lists of identified Ukrainians to be killed or sent to camps following a military occupation. The text also presents the Kremlin's denial of the accusation. The text does not appear to use any of the listed propaganda techniques to manipulate the audience's opinions or emotions.

## Prompt 7

## Response 7

* Name calling - No
* Repetition - No

* Black & white fallacy - No
* Thought terminating clichés - No
* Red herring - No
* Straw men - No

**Verdict**: The text contains some elements of propaganda. It appeals to fear, uses loaded language and appeals to authority to support its claims, uses intentional vagueness to confuse the audience, and charges the US with hypocrisy through whataboutism. However, the text also presents some factual information about the status of the New START treaty and the allegations made by the Russian Foreign Ministry. Therefore, it can be argued that the text is not entirely propaganda, but rather a mixture of factual information and propaganda techniques used to support a particular viewpoint.
